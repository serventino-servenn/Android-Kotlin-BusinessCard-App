# Business Card App

This repository contains my implementation of the basic Android Kotlin Compose business card project from the Android Developer website, following the completion of the basic layout codelab.Through this project, I learned how to create simple layouts using Row and Column, as well as how to apply modifiers to customize composable elements.

You can find the project link below, along with a screenshot of my design.
